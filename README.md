we aim to address the pressing challenge of stroke identification and prevention in the healthcare sector. Strokes, a major health concern globally, lead to diverse neurological issues, creating a significant societal and financial burden. The increasing incidence of strokes demands innovative solutions to enhance early detection and minimize the associated costs.


result:

The results displayed from the cross-validation process indicate that the Random Forest model has achieved high and consistent accuracy across all folds, with a mean cross-validation score of approximately 96.2% and a low standard deviation of 0.0085. This demonstrates the model's reliability and strong predictive performance across different subsets of the dataset, aligning with the high AUC value previously discussed. The low standard deviation suggests that the model's accuracy does not fluctuate much between different cross-validation folds, implying robustness and stability of the model.
